sublime-snippets
================

This is a collection of useful Sublime Text snippets. Sublime ships with a ton of great ones, but sometimes you need just a bit more.

Currently this just contains a bunch of Ruby-specific snippets, but I'll be adding to this repository as I come across more things that can be snippet-ized.

# Installation

To install on OS X, clone this repository to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/`. And that's it.

For Windows/*nix users, you'll need to do the same thing, but the path will obviously be different.
